Today we started our work on the google sheets coding. We learn a few basic functions such as product which multiplies all of the things you have selected together. We also learnt how to add a percentage onto a number to for example add tax. This can help if you suddenly want to increase a number or group of numbers by a certain percentage. We also found out how to count how many pieces of data there are using the count tool. There are also many mathematical equations like average, min,max and other basic maths functions.
