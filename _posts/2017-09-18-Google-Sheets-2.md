Today I carried on with google sheets in class we used percentages so you could use it as a tax for example. So you can have a number then add for example 20% onto the number. If the number was 5 then the answer would obviously be 6. We also used the vlookup command so that if there is a code then you can look the code up and it will put in the price and the name of the item and once you have put the quantity in it will times the quantity by price therefore getting the total price for that subsection of the order form.
