Today we looked at iserror which is a command/function which can tell if there is an error in a cell or if not. We used this in a if statement so that if the code had an error it would return zero making the overall cost of discount none and else if it was not an error it would search it from a discount list to see if there was an actual code which had been issued and it would return the code if so.
