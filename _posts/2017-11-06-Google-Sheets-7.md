Today we started a new topic of cryptography and shift cypher. Cryptography is simply when you can code and decode a message so that only who you want the message to be given to has the message.Shift Cypher is when you shift the cypher simply so you can code a message. You do it with letters so for example all of the letters shift 2 places down so A-C B-D etc. We also used the function Concatenate which if you had a box with 5 and another one with 8 to concatenate you would select the range of the two boxes and used concatenate it would come up with 58.
