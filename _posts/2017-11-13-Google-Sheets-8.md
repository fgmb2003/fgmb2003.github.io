Today we carried on doing shift cypher, coding and decoding we learnt how to make it so now we can put all of the code in one box instead of just putting a letter per box the way is a lot quicker and more efficient. The wav we did it is first we had a box with the len code in which is the length of the cell We then did left(right(the cell with the word, the cell with the length of the cell with the word - the cell above the cell this was in and this was 0 then 1 then 2 etc. This is how we could code it in one cell.
