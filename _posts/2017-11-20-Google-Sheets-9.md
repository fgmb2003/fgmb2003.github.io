Today we didn't really learn any new functions or how to improve our work, we just used our previous knowledge in an actual problem and a real life situation. We carried on with our shift cypher and we just learnt about how to make our cypher quicker by again putting all of letters into one box instead of just having a separate box for each letter. This way it is a lot quicker and more useful. We did this by using the left and right functions and also len to find the length so we could do it quicker and copy across by having a number above every box and this makes it quicker and more efficient. This is our final IT lesson for this term.
